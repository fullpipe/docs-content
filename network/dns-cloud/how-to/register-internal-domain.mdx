Domains and DNS is a managed service, that allows you to register a domain name and configure its DNS zones from a graphical interface. It provides support for queries via both IPv4 and IPv6 and supports all common types of DNS records.

Scaleway DNS is currently available to manage DNS zones for external domains (domains created at external registrars).

2. Enter the domain name in the box and click the search icon to verify the domain is available. 
 
 A selection of available domain names displays.

3. Check the domain names you want to register. Then click **Select and configure contacts**.

4. If you already have a domain you can select the same contacts to be used for your domain name. If you do not have any contact, click **Create contact** to create a new one. 

5. Click **Validate and continue**.

6. Choose the registration period. The total pricing for your order displays. 

7. Click **Validate** to confirm your order and to register the domain name.

Make sure to check your domain name for any spelling issues before you place the order. You cannot change the domain name once the registration is complete and the fees will still apply. You can of course make a new registration with the correctly spelled domain name.
