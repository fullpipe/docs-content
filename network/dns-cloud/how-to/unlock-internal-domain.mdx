Domain names are locked by default to avoid any unsolicited outgoing transfer. In case you want to transfer your domain name to another registrar, you can unlock it from your Scaleway console.

    * The authentication key is a secret key that launches the transfer of your domain name. We recommend you take note of it and not share it with anyone.
    * Make sure your domain name is locked at all times, unless you want to transfer it.
