You can renew your domain name at any time during the validity period, directly from the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). It is not necessary to wait until your domain name is near its expiration to renew it.

The renewal conditions for domain names vary depending on the TLD:

* For gTLDs (.COM .NET .ORG .BIZ .INFO .NAME .MOBI) and .US :
    You can renew an internal name for one or more years without the total duration of the contract exceeding 10 years (for example, an internal name that is in its last year of validity can be renewed for a maximum of nine years).

* For ccTLDs (.BE, .LU, .DE, .AT, .CH, .LI and .IT)
    These domain names can only be renewed for a period of one year. They must therefore be renewed annually.

* For ccTLDs (.CO.UK, .ORG.UK)
    These domain names can only be renewed for a period of two years.

Once your domain is expired it enters the **redemption period**. During this period, the domain name can be restored by a late renewal. The renewal period for late renewals is one year only and a service fee applies.
